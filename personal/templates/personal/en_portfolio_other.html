<h1> Overview</h1>
<p style="padding:5 5 5 5;">The current website was designed based on my personal interests. However, it no longer fit my needs like it used to. First, It is necessary to clarify the website's purpose is needed as it plays an important role in presenting my skills on the job market. Second, the content of each project is very important, as it can help explain what has been the work process in addition to the result. Third, there is currently no way to find out the number of daily visitors. I need a well-designed website with a focus on showcasing my UX design and computer science skills.</p>

<h1> Goals </h1>
<p>Add a introduction, clarify the purpose of website.</p>
<p>Elaborate on the implementation process for each of the projects.</p>
<p>Add a way to visualize of the number of daily visitors.</p>

<h1> Start by hand</h1>
<!-- <p>Start by hand is the best way to save a designer's time always.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Also, take a piece of paper arround to get advice is much easier then computer.</p> -->
